# RetrUp
RetrUp is a platform where the users can create or participate in Retro-themed events.

### Events
Events are divided into several categories, the user being able to select their preferences, thus having personalized results:
 - music
 - fashion
 - gaming
 - culture
 - sport
### Install RetrUp
In order to run the app, expo-cli needs to be installed globally:
```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Once the repository has been cloned, several commands need to be executed:
```sh
$ cd react-native
$ npm install
$ expo start -c
```

It is important to note that while the app is being tested on an emulator, [the push notifications will not work](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/)!
